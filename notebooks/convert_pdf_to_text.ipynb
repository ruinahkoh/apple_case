       "  'text': 'iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide\\nFriday February 28, 2025 4:01 PM PST by Juli Clover\\nIn 2007, Apple launched the original iPhone, kickstarting the modern smartphone era which\\nis now dominated by iPhone and Android devices. We\\'ve had 18 generations of iPhones so\\nfar, with the latest models, the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro\\nMax, introduced in September 2024, and the iPhone 16e released in February 2025. Apple\\nfollows an annual update cycle, introducing new flagship models while discounting prior-\\nyear models and selling them at more affordable price points.\\niPhone vs Android\\nOver the years, Android and iPhone smartphones have evolved to the point where feature-\\nwise, they\\'re similar in function and capability. Android smartphones are made by multiple\\nmanufacturers, but the core operating system is provided by Google, which leads to a wider\\nAll >\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 1/15 variety of phones and price points to choose from, but weaker integration between software\\nand hardware.\\nApple\\'s control of both the iPhone and the operating system (iOS) provides a more\\nconsistent experience along with ongoing support. With iOS 18, Apple supports all iPhones\\nthat were introduced in the last four years, so the majority of active iPhone owners can and\\ndo upgrade to the newest version of iOS that Apple rolls out each year.\\nAndroid updates are often more inconsistent and often don\\'t make it to all Android-based\\nsmartphones because each manufacturer has to implement support on an individual basis.\\nSo while Google also does yearly Android updates, the reality is that a lot of older Android\\nsmartphones don\\'t get the new software.\\nWith Apple\\'s control and curation of the iPhone experience, the iPhone is largely considered\\nto be the more secure platform, and Apple has made it a point to focus heavily on privacy.\\nApple\\'s iOS is less customizable than Android, though, so for individuals who prefer\\nflexibility and customization options, the Android operating system may be worth looking\\nat.\\nHow Do iPhone Updates Work?\\nHere are the basics you should know about how Apple updates the iPhone and the iOS\\noperating system.\\nEach fall, typically in September, Apple releases a new series of flagship smartphones.\\nThese often come at high prices and feature the latest technologies, with Apple offering\\nhigh-end models and still high-end but more affordable models.

The current iPhones run\\niOS 18.\\nIn this guide, we go over all of the iPhones that are in the current Apple lineup, offer up\\nsome buying suggestions, and provide tips and resources for both new and existing iPhone\\nowners.\\niPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max ($999+)\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple\\'s current high-end flagship devices with\\nall of the top-of-the-line features and the most bells and whistles. The Pro models are for\\nthose who want to get the most out of their iPhones with the latest feature set.\\nPricing on the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while pricing on the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at\\n$1,199. The two iPhones are nearly identical when it comes to feature set, and it\\'s only\\ndisplay size and battery capacity that set the two devices apart.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 3/15 Apple introduced larger screen sizes and slimmed down bezels for the Pro lineup in 2024, so\\nthe iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display (up from 6.7 inches), and the iPhone\\n16 Pro has a 6.3 inch display (up from 6.1 inches). Both models feature the same design\\nwith a glass front and back, a lightweight but durable titanium frame, and squircle edges.\\nColors this year include natural titanium, white titanium, black titanium, and desert\\ntitanium, which is a shade of gold.\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max feature edge-to-edge OLED displays with the slimmest\\nbezels we\\'ve seen in an iPhone to date. There\\'s a second-generation \"Ceramic Shield\" that\\noffers superior scratch resistance, and a pill-shaped Dynamic Island continues to house the\\nfront-facing camera and hardware used for Face ID authentication.\\nThe customizable Action button is still available, and it now does more thanks to Control\\nCenter integration. This year, Apple also added a Camera Control button that can be used to\\nactivate the camera with a press. Camera Control makes it quicker to capture photos and\\nvideos, and it is also pressure and touch sensitive so you can change controls and adjust\\nsettings without touching the screen.\\nThe Dynamic Island has been incorporated into the iPhone\\'s interface and it is able to show\\nvarious notifications and app information for phone calls, timers, Face ID, Bluetooth\\nconnections, and more.\\nApple added a new A18 Pro chip to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, with a 6-core CPU, a 6-\\ncore GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is up to 20 percent faster than the A17 Pro from\\nthe iPhone 15 Pro models, and it is the fastest iPhone for Apple Intelligence.\\nThere continues to be a three-lens camera setup with a 48-megapixel Main camera that\\noffers improved low-light performance, a 12-megapixel 5x Telephoto lens, and a new 48-\\nmegapixel Ultra Wide camera. The 5x Telephoto is available for both Pro models, which is\\nnew this year, and the 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera takes improved wide-angle and\\nmacro shots when lighting is poor.\\nCrash Detection is able to determine if you\\'ve been in a serious car accident, alerting\\nemergency services, and there\\'s also an Emergency SOS via satellite feature for getting\\nhelp if you\\'re out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular. With iOS 18, the satellite connectivity can\\nbe used to send messages too.\\nBoth iPhone 16 Pro models offer improvements to battery life, and they have a USB-C port\\nand support for up to 25W MagSafe charging.\\nOther features include IP68 water resistance, 8GB RAM, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate for\\nthe display, faster 5G, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, faster USB-C charging,\\nand Wi-Fi 7.\\nKey Features:\\nHighest end, highest price\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 4/15 Triple-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide, and Telephoto (5x for the Max)\\n48-megapixel Main lens with ProRAW support\\n48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens with macro capability\\nCamera Control button\\nA18 Pro chip\\nAction button\\nAlways-On Display\\nTitanium frame\\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are the iPhones to choose if you\\nwant the absolute best camera capabilities that you can get in an iPhone, with the Pro Max\\nbeing the top-of-the-line model due to its increased display size, and longer battery life. In\\nterms of performance, there isn\\'t much of a difference between the iPhone 16 Pro models\\nand the standard iPhone 16 models, with screen size, display quality, and chassis material\\ndifferentiating the two iPhone lines.\\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus ($799+)\\nSold alongside the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\\nare Apple\\'s more affordable flagship devices. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus feature many of\\nthe same capabilities as the Pro models, but they are missing some of the higher-end\\nfeatures to keep the price lower. The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 is priced starting at $799, while\\nthe 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus is priced starting at $899.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 5/15 Despite the difference in screen size, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are essentially identical,\\nfeaturing a flat-edged design with a glass body and an aluminum frame. They do not offer\\nProMotion display technology and thus do not support an always-on display, but they do\\nhave the same Dynamic Island, front-facing camera, and Face ID authentication\\nfunctionality.\\nApple brought the Action button to the iPhone 16 lineup this year, so that is no longer a\\nPro-only feature. The Action button replaces the Ring/Silent switch, and it is customizable,\\nso you can set it to bring up whatever is most convenient for you. It can mute/unmute your\\niPhone, activate the flashlight, open a favorite app, activate a Control Center control, turn\\non a Focus mode, and more.\\nLike the iPhone 16 Pro models, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have a new Camera\\nControl button below the power button. Pressing the button activates the camera, and a\\ndouble press snaps a photo, so it makes it much quicker to get the shot that you want. The\\nbutton is capacitive and pressure sensitive, so it can be used for changing various camera\\nsettings and swapping between tools. It works much like a DSLR shutter for autofocus with\\na half press, and you can adjust exposure, style, zoom, aperture, and more without ever\\ntouching the iPhone\\'s display.\\nWhile the iPhone 16 Pro models have an A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 models have an\\nalmost-as-capable A18 chip that also works with Apple Intelligence. The A18 has the same\\n6-core CPU and 16-core Neural Engine, but it has a 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU.\\nThe chip is built using the same 3-nanometer technology, and it enables support for ray\\ntracing and console-quality games, a feature that was previously limited to the Pro models.\\nBattery life has improved compared to the prior iPhone 15 models thanks to the new chip\\ntechnology.\\nThere is a dual camera system that features 12-megapixel Ultra Wide and 48-megapixel\\nFusion (Wide) lenses with no Telephoto lens. The primary camera can be cropped in to a 2x\\nzoom, so 0.5, 1x, and 2x options are supported. Some of the same photography and\\nvideography capabilities that are in the Pro models are also in the standard iPhone 16\\nmodels, including the new Photographic Styles for customizing your images and Audio Mix\\nfor adjusting the sound in your videos, plus support for shooting spatial videos and images.\\nCapturing video in 4K at 120 frames per second is a Pro-only feature, as is support for\\nshooting in ProRAW and ProRes, so if those are capabilities you need, you\\'ll want to look at\\nthe Pro models.\\nThe iPhone 16 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G, and they\\nalso have a USB-C port and offer MagSafe charging at up to 25W, a new, faster speed this\\nyear. Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Messages via satellite are available\\nas well. Compared to the Pro models, the standard models lack the titanium chassis, the\\nTelephoto camera lens, and the A18 Pro chip.\\nKey Features:\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 6/15 Dual-lens camera: Fusion (Wide), Ultra Wide\\nCrash Detection\\nUSB-C port\\nAction button\\nCamera Control\\nA18 chip\\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus offer many of the same features as the iPhone 16\\nPro and 16 Pro Max at a more affordable price, and these are the iPhones that we\\nrecommend for most people. The differences are limited primarily to the camera and the\\ndisplay, and may not be of interest for those who are not heavily invested in iPhone\\nphotography, making the $200+ savings worth it for most. Older iPhones are another\\noption to save money, but be aware that only the four iPhone 16 models and the prior-\\ngeneration iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support Apple Intelligence.\\niPhone 16e ($599+)\\nPriced starting at $599, the iPhone 16e is similar in design to the iPhone 16, but it is\\nactually modeled after the iPhone 14. It has an all-display design with Face ID, but it has an\\nolder-style notch rather than a Dynamic Island.\\nThe iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED display like the iPhone 16, and it has the same 8GB\\nRAM and A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, though there is one less GPU core. It is\\nthe first iPhone with Apple\\'s new C1 modem, which is more efficient than Qualcomm\\'s\\ncomparable X71 modem in the iPhone 16. While there is no mmWave 5G support, there\\nseems to be no compromise to the more widespread sub-6GHz Wi-Fi speeds.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 7/15 There is a single-lens rear camera in the iPhone 16e, and it is the same as the 48-\\nmegapixel Wide camera in the iPhone 16. It can take 1x and 2x photos, but there is no 0.5x\\noption and no 5x zoom as there is in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\\nThe iPhone 16e has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone, and the battery lasts for\\nup to 26 hours when watching video. It charges via USB-C, but it does not support MagSafe\\nand wireless charging is limited to 7.5W. Not being able to use MagSafe is one of the main\\ndownsides to the iPhone 16e.\\nIt is also worth noting that there is no Ultra Wideband chip for Precision Finding in the Find\\nMy app, and it is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so it will not connect to the 6GHz networks available\\nwith Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers.\\nOther features include Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via Satellite, and Messages via\\nSatellite, but these are also features available with other iPhone 16 models.\\nKey Features:\\nFace ID\\nA18 chip\\nLower price\\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16e is now Apple\\'s lowest-price iPhone, and it is worthwhile if\\nyou can live without a dual-lens camera system, faster Wi-Fi connectivity, and MagSafe. It\\nhas many of the same features as the iPhone 16 at a $200 lower price point.\\niPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus ($699+)\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 8/15 The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are Apple\\'s prior-generation flagship devices that are now\\nbeing sold at a discount. They have older technology and are lacking some of the new\\nfeatures that Apple introduced with the iPhone 16 models, including the Camera Control\\nbutton, the faster A-series chip, the Action button, and, most importantly, support for Apple\\nIntelligence. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus cannot run the new Apple Intelligence\\nfeatures in iOS 18, so only consider Apple\\'s prior-generation iPhones if that is not important\\nto you.\\nThe iPhone 15 models don\\'t look notably different from the iPhone 16 models, except for\\nthe color options. Apple did not make major design changes, but the iPhone 15 models do\\nnot have a Camera Control button and they have a Ring/Silent switch instead of an Action\\nbutton. There\\'s also a diagonal rear camera setup that does not offer some of the newer\\ncamera capabilities like Photographic Styles for customizing the look of your images or\\nAudio Mix for tweaking the sound in your videos.\\nWhile the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus don\\'t support some of the newer software-based camera\\nfeatures, the hardware is largely the same. There\\'s a Main (Wide) lens that supports 1x and\\n2x zoom, and an Ultra Wide lens. There is no dedicated Telephoto lens.\\nThe iPhone 15 measures in at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 15 Plus is 6.7 inches. The two\\ndevices are essentially identical, with a Dynamic Island for Face ID, aluminum frames, and\\nOLED screen technology. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have an older A16 chip that is\\ntwo generations behind the newer chips in the current flagship models.\\nThe iPhone 15 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G and use the\\nX70 Qualcomm chip, one generation behind the Qualcomm chip in the new iPhones. Battery\\nlife is a little shorter, but the iPhone 15 models do support MagSafe and USB-C. There is no\\nsupport for the faster 25W MagSafe charging, though, with the iPhone 15 models limited to\\n15W MagSafe charging.\\nBetween the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the features are identical with the exception of screen\\nsize and battery, as the iPhone 15 Plus can accommodate a larger battery size.\\nKey Features:\\nDiagonal dual-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide\\nCrash Detection\\nUSB-C port\\nDynamic Island\\n5G support\\nA16 chip\\nBottom Line: The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are solid devices that will perform well at an\\naffordable price, but keep in mind that the iPhone 16 is such a notable upgrade that it may\\nbe worth paying $100 more for the iPhone 16 this year. The iPhone 15 models do not have\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 9/15 an Action button or a Camera Control button, and they cannot run the Apple Intelligence\\nfeatures in iOS 18, so you\\'d be missing out on the more capable Siri, customizable emoji,\\nWriting Tools, and other Apple Intelligence functions. A prior-generation iPhone is usually a\\ngood way to save money, but this year, we don\\'t recommend it.\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nThere\\'s no one single iPhone that\\'s best for everyone, and picking the right smartphone\\nneeds to take into account factors like budget, desired battery life, preferred feature set,\\nand more.\\nIf you want the absolute best photographic capabilities for example, you\\'re going to want\\nthe iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max, and if you want something that has a solid feature\\nset at a great price, the iPhone 16e is what you\\'ll want to look at.\\nBelow, we\\'ve outlined some of the best iPhone choices based on different scenarios or\\nfeatures that you might be looking for.\\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Battery Life?\\nWith the efficient A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the longest battery life for any\\niPhone to date at up to 33 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16\\nPlus are second and will last up to 27 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16e lasts for\\nup to 26 hours when watching videos, and it is the smallest of the bunch at 6.1 inches.\\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Camera?\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 iPhone: 2025 Buyer\\'s Guide - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/ 10/15 With their updated triple-lens camera systems, 48-megapixel Fusion lens, 5x Telephoto\\nlens, 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and LiDAR Scanners, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16\\nPro Max have the best iPhone cameras that you can get. Both of the new iPhones include a\\nthree-lens camera system with the same feature set. This year, the Ultra Wide lens has\\nbeen upgraded to 48 megapixels, allowing for more detailed wide-angle and macro shots.\\nThe Fusion lens supports 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution photos through\\nthe Photonic Engine, and the Ultra Wide lens supports 12-megapixel images that have the\\ndetail from the combined pixels of the 48-megapixel resolution. Using computational\\nphotography, the Fusion camera can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths to\\nbetter mirror what\\'s possible with DSLRs.\\nAll four iPhone 16 models have a new Camera Control button that makes it easier to\\ncapture a photo or a video with just a couple of button presses, and the Camera Control\\nbutton is also capacitive and pressure sensitive so it can be used for changing photography\\nmodes and adjusting settings, which makes your iPhone feel more like a camera.\\nWhich iPhone Has Touch ID?\\nUnfortunately, none of Apple\\'s iPhones have Touch ID. It has been phased out, and Face ID\\nis the only option.\\nWhich iPhone is Best For One-Handed Use?\\nThe iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e both measure in at 6.1 inches, and they are the smallest\\niPhones that Apple makes. They won\\'t work for one-handed use for everyone, but they are\\na better option than the 16 Plus and 16 Pro Max.\\nWhich iPhone is the Best Value?\\nWith Apple Intelligence support, a 48-megapixel camera, OLED display, and 5G connectivity\\nfor $599, the iPhone 16e is the best deal that Apple offers. If you need faster mmWave 5G\\nspeeds, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, MagSafe, and an Ultra Wide camera, the $799 iPhone 16 is the\\nupgrade option.\\nIf you don\\'t need the latest bells and whistles like Apple Intelligence and don\\'t mind losing\\nout on a bit of performance and battery life, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, which are $100\\ncheaper than than their iPhone 16 counterparts, could be worth considering.\\nFor many people, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16e are the iPhones to get this year with their\\nlower price point and modern feature set.\\nWhich iPhone Has the Most Features?\\nIf you want the iPhone with the most bells and whistles, that\\'s the iPhone 16 Pro and\\niPhone 16 Pro Max.

The Apple Watch is a great health, fitness, and\\ncommunication tool, but there\\'s a lot to consider when making a purchase.\\nYou need to choose the case material and band, pick a GPS or cellular model, and decide\\nwhether to buy the latest Apple Watch or spring for a more affordable older model.\\nThis guide walks you through the different options you can choose from with the aim of\\nhelping you figure out which Apple Watch will best meet your needs, but it assumes you\\'re\\nalready aware of the feature set.\\nIf you want to know what the Apple Watch can do, our Apple Watch roundup is a good\\nresource with an overview of features like the always-on display, Blood Oxygen monitoring\\n(and the controversies surrounding it), heart rate tracking, ECG functionality, and more.\\nApple Watch Series 10 vs. Apple Watch SE\\nAll >\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 1/34 For most of the lifetime of the Apple Watch there\\'s been a new flagship model and an older,\\nless powerful model to choose between, but that changed starting in 2020 with the\\nintroduction of the low-cost Apple Watch SE, a more affordable Apple Watch option that offers\\nmuch of the same functionality as the flagship model but at a lower cost.\\nAs of September 2024, Apple is selling the Apple Watch Series 10, which starts at $399, and\\nthe second-generation  Apple Watch SE , which starts at $249, and there are multiple\\ndifferences that make it easy to decide between the two. There\\'s also a higher-end Apple\\nWatch Ultra 2, outlined below.\\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 and the second-generation  Apple Watch SE  have different form\\nfactors thanks to redesigns that Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 two years\\nago and just this year with the Series 10. The Series 10 comes in 42mm and 46mm case\\nsizes, features a slimmed-down profile, and it has a larger display with thinner bezels.\\nThe  Apple Watch SE  comes in 40mm and 44mm case sizes and has thicker bezels dating back\\nto the Series 6 design. There are several major features that the SE is missing compared to\\nthe Series 10: ECG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, temperature sensing, Double Tap\\ngestures, on-device Siri, and a brighter, always-on display.\\nThe Series 10 is the more durable model, plus it features fast charging feature that charges it\\nfrom 0 to 80 percent in only 30 minutes. The Series 10 is equipped with the latest S10 chip,\\nwhile the  Apple Watch SE  has an earlier-generation S8 chip, so the Series 10 is faster. Apple\\nalso equipped the Series 10 with a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for more accurate\\npositioning, which the  Apple Watch SE  does not have. Crash Detection, the feature that alerts\\nemergency services if you\\'re in an accident, is available in both models.\\nIf you want any (or all) of these features, the Series 10 is the best pick, but if you don\\'t need\\nthe feature set offered by the Apple Watch Series 10 and are mainly interested in standard\\nhealth and fitness functionality like heart rate and movement tracking along with notifications\\nand similar features, you can save a decent amount of money opting for the  Apple Watch SE .\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 2/34 Apple Watch Series 10\\n46mm or 42mm case size\\nAlways-on Retina LTPO OLED display\\nwith wide-angle viewing\\nSlimmer bezels with 25–30% more\\nscreen area\\nGPS and GPS + Cellular models\\n64-bit dual-core S10 Chip\\nDouble tap gesture\\nW3 wireless chip\\nHaptic Digital Crown\\nOptical heart sensor\\nTemperature sensing\\nHeart rate notifications\\nEmergency SOS (International)\\nFall Detection\\nCrash Detection\\nNoise monitoring\\nWater resistance up to 50 meters\\nDepth gauge and Depth app up to 6\\nmeters\\n5GHz Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5.3\\nSupport for Family Setup\\nCompass and always-on altimeter\\n64GB capacity\\n18-hour \"all-day\" battery life\\nGen 2 Ultra Wideband chip\\nBlood Oxygen app (disabled in U.S.)\\nECG app\\nFast charging (0–80% in 30\\nminutes)\\nAluminum and Titanium options\\nJet Black, Rose Gold, and Silver\\naluminum colors\\nSlate, Gold, and Natural titanium\\ncolors\\nApple Watch SE\\n44mm or 40mm case size\\nStandard Retina LTPO OLED display\\nGPS and GPS + Cellular models\\n64-bit dual-core S8 Chip\\nNo gesture support\\nW3 wireless chip\\nHaptic Digital Crown\\nOptical heart sensor\\nHeart rate notifications\\nEmergency SOS (International)\\nFall Detection\\nCrash Detection\\nNoise monitoring\\nWater resistance up to 50 meters\\nNo depth gauge or Depth app\\n2.4GHz Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5.3\\nSupport for  Family Setup \\nCompass and always-on altimeter\\n32GB capacity\\n18-hour \"all-day\" battery life\\nNo Ultra-Wideband chip\\nNo Blood Oxygen app\\nNo ECG app\\nSlower charging\\nGold, Silver, and Space Gray\\nAluminum only\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that the  Apple Watch SE  does not come in titanium, so your only option\\nis an aluminum casing in silver, space gray, or gold if you opt for the more affordable model.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 3/34 Apple Watch Ultra 2\\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Ultra 2, a higher-end Apple Watch that is aimed at\\nthose who need a more rugged, durable model. The Apple Watch Ultra is the most feature-\\nrich Apple Watch, but it is also the most expensive at $799. A new satin black color option\\nand some new band styles and colors were introduced in September 2024, but the specs\\nremained the same.\\nCompared to the Series 10, the Apple Watch Ultra has an beefier design with squared edges\\nthat are designed to protect the sapphire crystal display, along with a protected Digital Crown.\\nIt is equipped with a customizable Action button that is not on other Apple Watch models,\\nwith the button able to launch apps, workouts, and more. There is also a built-in 86-decibel\\nsiren, and it has more precise L5 GPS capabilities.\\nBattery life is also longer, the display is much brighter, and since it is titanium, it is light and\\ndurable. Water resistance is better so that it can support deeper diving, plus it has all of the\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 4/34 features in the Series 10.\\nThe  Apple Watch Ultra 2  is only available in titanium and it only comes in a 49mm size, which\\nmay not fit all wrists. With its long list of features, the Apple Watch Ultra is the absolute best\\nand most advanced Apple Watch you can buy at this time, though the Series 10 features a\\nslightly larger display with better wide-angle viewing.\\n49mm case size\\nAlways-on Retina LTPO OLED display\\n3% smaller but brighter screen (3000 nits)\\nDedicated Wayfinder Face with Night Mode for low-visibility conditions\\nCustomizable Action Button\\nMil-STD-810H durability rating\\nDual speakers and three-mic array with beamforming\\nCellular connectivity + L5/L1 GPS for better accuracy\\n64-bit dual-core S9 Chip\\nDouble Tap gesture\\nW3 wireless chip\\nHaptic Digital Crown\\nOptical heart sensor\\nTemperature sensing\\nHeart rate notifications\\nEmergency SOS (International)\\nFall Detection\\nCrash Detection\\n86-decibel siren\\nNoise monitoring\\nWater resistance up to 100 meters, EN13319 certification\\nWater temperature sensor, plus depth gauge and Depth app up to 40 meters\\n5GHz Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5.3\\nCompass and always-on altimeter\\n32GB capacity\\n36-hour battery life, 2x Series 10\\nGen 2 Ultra-Wideband chip\\nBlood Oxygen app (disabled in U.S.)\\nECG app\\nFast charging (0–80% in 1 hour)\\nTitanium casing\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 5/34 Apple Watch Sizing\\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 comes in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm, while the  Apple Watch SE \\ncomes in 40mm and 44mm sizes. The  Apple Watch Ultra 2  is available in a single 49mm size.\\nApple says that the 40mm/41mm/42mm Apple Watch is designed to fit 130 to 200mm wrists,\\nwhile the 44mm/45mm/46mm Apple Watch is designed to fit 140 to 220mm wrists. The\\n49mm Apple Watch Ultra can fit wrists sized 130mm to 220mm.\\nWhen choosing a case size, you need to consider your wrist size and how you want the Apple\\nWatch to fit. People with small wrists will likely want to opt for a 40mm/41mm/42mm model,\\nwhile people with larger wrists will want to opt for a 44mm/45mm/46mm model. The 49mm\\nApple Watch Ultra is very large and can look oversized on many wrists, but it should fit\\nanyone able to wear a 44mm/45mm/46mm Apple Watch.\\nFor some people, size choice will be obvious, but for those who have medium-sized wrists\\nwhere the choice is less clear cut, the best solution is visiting an Apple Store or a retail\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 6/34 location that sells the Apple Watch to try it on because there\\'s really no substitute for seeing\\nthe way that it fits on the wrist in person. We especially recommend trying the Apple Watch\\nUltra in person because it is large, but sized to fit on any wrist.\\nApple Watch Model Options\\nThere are two different casing materials available: aluminum and titanium, along with special\\nApple Watches designed in partnership with Hermès and Nike.\\nAll Apple Watch models, regardless of casing material, have the same internal components\\nand capabilities.\\nApple Watch Aluminum\\nAluminum Apple Watches are the lightest weight and the most affordable Apple Watches that\\nApple sells. Apple in the past marketed its aluminum Apple Watch models as \"sport\" models\\nfor their light weight, but has since dropped the sport branding. Aluminum is not as durable\\nas some of the other casing options, but it has the benefit of being less heavy.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 7/34 The aluminum is a soft, brushed aluminum for the silver and rose gold colors, but polished to\\na glossy, reflective shine on the jet black models. These models are not, however, as tough as\\ntitanium casings. Aluminum Apple Watch models have an Ion-X glass display, which is less\\nscratch-resistant than the sapphire glass used in more expensive models.\\nFor most people, the aluminum Apple Watch is the best choice because it\\'s ideal for all kinds\\nof activities and it\\'s the most affordable, starting at $399 for the Series 10 42mm model and\\n$429 for the 46mm model. LTE models are $100 more. Aluminum  Apple Watch SE  models are\\neven cheaper, starting at $249 for the 40mm model.\\nApple Watch Titanium\\nApple previously used stainless steel for its middle-tier Apple Watch models but upgraded\\nthese to titanium with the Series 10. They\\'re more expensive than the aluminum models but\\nless expensive than the Apple Watch Ultra models that also use titanium.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 8/34 Compared to the aluminum models that are designed for everyday wear including activity, the\\ntitanium models have more of a high-end professional look. Titanium Apple Watches are\\nheavier than aluminum models and may be preferred by those who like a heftier weight on\\nthe wrist.\\nTitanium Apple Watch Series 10 models come in slate, gold, and natural, with an aerospace-\\ngrade polished finish for all three colors. Unfortunately, that shiny finish can be more prone to\\nscratching than aluminum, but it looks nicer.\\nApple\\'s titanium models also feature sapphire crystal for the displays instead of Ion-X glass,\\nso the displays are more resistant to scratching and damage.\\nPaired with Apple\\'s cheapest band options, the titanium Apple Watches start at $699 for the\\n42mm model and $749 for the 46mm model. All models include support for LTE connectivity.\\nApple Watch Ultra in Titanium\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 9/34 The Apple Watch Ultra is Apple\\'s most expensive Apple Watch option for those who are\\nlooking for a higher-end, premium watch.\\nThe titanium casing of the  Apple Watch Ultra 2  has a unique brushed finish that\\'s stain and\\nfingerprint resistant. It comes in a natural titanium finish or a satin black finish that\\'s new for\\n2024, and it is worth noting that while the titanium Apple Watch Ultra is heavier than the\\n46mm titanium Series 10 option, users generally feel it is light and comfortable on the wrist\\nbecause of the material and the size distribution.\\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is priced starting at $799. It is ideal for those who need the more\\nadvanced durability and functionality for specialized activities like diving and hiking in remote\\nareas where more advanced GPS can come in handy.\\nApple Watch Nike\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 10/34 Designed in collaboration with Nike and aimed at runners, the Apple Watch Nike models are\\nidentical in every way to Apple\\'s aluminum Apple Watch models. They can be purchased with\\nspecial Nike-branded bands, though, including reflective Sport Loops in unique colors and\\nSport Bands with perforations for better aeration.\\nNike Apple Watches also have unique Nike watch faces and come pre-installed with the Nike\\nRun Club app. Like aluminum Apple Watch models, Nike Apple Watch options start at $399.\\nNike Apple Watch models are ideal for runners, fans of the Nike brand, or those who simply\\nprefer the look of Nike bands.\\nApple Watch Hermès\\nCreated in collaboration with Hermès and aimed at those looking for a higher-end luxury\\nwatch, the Apple Watch Hermès models come in a silver titanium finish designed to match the\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 11/34 stainless steel of previous generations and are functionally identical to Apple\\'s standard\\ntitanium Series 10 models, but with high-end, expensive Hermès band options.\\nLike Nike Apple Watch models, Hermès Apple Watches feature unique Hermès watch faces\\nthat are not available on other Apple Watch options. All Hermès Apple Watches also come\\nwith a special Hermès Orange Sport Band.\\nApple Watch Hermès models are priced starting at $1249, and they are available in a silver\\ntitanium finish. Apple has also introduced an Apple Watch Hermès Ultra 2 for $1399.\\nBand Choices\\nApple\\'s standard aluminum and titanium Apple Watch models can be paired with almost any\\nof the bands that Apple sells through the Apple Watch Studio feature on Apple\\'s website.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 12/34 Once you\\'re selected a model on the Apple Watch purchase page, click through the\\nconfiguration steps until you reach the band section where you can choose from available\\nrubber, textile, and stainless steel bands with any case pairing. Below is an overview of each\\nband option that can be added to a standard watch:\\nSolo Loop ($49) - Similar to the Sport Band, the Solo Loop features a slip-on design\\nwith no buckle or clasping mechanism. It\\'s made from a stretchy rubber that can fit\\nover the hand and then collapse down to fit the wrist. These bands come in nine\\nsizes, and finding the right size can be tricky, so it\\'s best to get fitted in an  Apple\\nStore  if you can.\\nBraided Solo Loop ($99) - The Braided Solo Loop is also designed without a buckle\\nor clasp, and it is made from a stretchable recycled yarn interwoven with silicone\\nthreads so it can fit over the hand. As with the Solo Loop, getting the right fit can be\\nchallenging, so visiting an  Apple Store  is your best bet so you don\\'t have to hassle\\nwith returns.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 13/34 Sport Band ($49) - Sport Bands are made from a flexible and lightweight\\nfluoroelastomer that\\'s designed for use when exercising or vigorous activity.

They\\'re fabric so if you get them\\nwet they\\'re going to feel damp, but they dry quickly. Sport Loops are also available in\\na range of colors.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 15/34 Nike Band ($49) - Sold with Nike Watches or standalone, Nike Bands are similar to\\nSport Bands but have a perforated design with holes for better breathability. There\\nare also Nike Sport Loops in unique colors.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 16/34 Modern Buckle ($149) - While the Modern Buckle was previously made from\\nleather, it now constructed of a microtwill material dubbed \"FineWoven\" by Apple and\\nis limited to the smaller 41mm Apple Watch models. It features a two-piece magnetic\\nbuckle and it has the bulkiest fastening mechanism of Apple\\'s watch options.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 17/34 Magnetic Link - Replacing the previous Leather Link style, the Magnetic Link is also\\nmade of FineWoven material with a magnetic clasp, and it comes in a range of muted\\ncolors.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 18/34 Link Bracelet - ($349 to $449) - The Link Bracelet, made from a stainless steel\\nalloy, is Apple\\'s most expensive band.

The top loops provide adjustability and an attachment point for the\\ntitanium fastener. It is designed for the Ultra, but compatible with other models.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 20/34 Trail Loop - The Trail Loop is Apple\\'s thinnest band to date, modeled after the Sport\\nLoop.

Current color options for each type of Apple Watch can be found on\\nApple\\'s website.\\nCellular vs. GPS-Only\\nSince the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple has offered both cellular models with LTE connectivity\\nand less expensive GPS-only models that do not have cellular connectivity.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 25/34 With an LTE connection, the Apple Watch is untethered from the iPhone and does not require\\nan  iPhone  or a known Wi-Fi network for an internet connection. This means that Maps, Phone,\\nMessages, Apple Pay, and more can all be used on the Apple Watch without an  iPhone .\\nWith the dedicated App Store, the Apple Watch can be used almost entirely independently of\\nan  iPhone , though an  iPhone  is still needed for some functions.\\nLTE connectivity through a carrier also requires that an  iPhone  be on the cellular plan, so a\\ncellular Apple Watch cannot be purchased and used without an  iPhone . Most cellular plans for\\nthe Apple Watch add a $10 monthly fee to your cellular phone bill. LTE connectivity is the\\ndefault in the higher-end Apple Watches, but aluminum LTE models are $100 more expensive.\\nIf you\\'re always going to use an Apple Watch with an  iPhone , there\\'s probably no need for\\ncellular connectivity, but if you\\'d like to leave the  iPhone  behind for activities like runs and\\nhikes, the cellular feature is worth considering.\\n07/05/2025, 16:09 Picking the Best Apple Watch to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-watch-to-buy/ 26/34 Apple Watches with LTE are available in many countries around the world, with a list available\\non Apple\\'s website.

The Nike models, if you prefer that aesthetic, are identical to the\\naluminum Apple Watch models.\\nThose looking for a higher-end watch that\\'s still affordable should check out the titanium\\nmodels, while those who want the best Apple has to offer should take a look at the Apple\\nWatch Ultra. If you want the extra durability and specialized functionality like Action button or\\nsiren, the Apple Watch Ultra is the device to choose.\\nBand choice and size is pretty much personal preference. Sport Bands and Sport Loops are\\nsome of the most comfortable options and come in a range of colors that change seasonally,\\nwhile Apple\\'s higher-end bands offer a classier look, although many users have been critical\\nof Apple\\'s leather-replacement FineWoven material used in the Modern Buckle and Magnetic\\nLink.

       "  'text': 'Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025\\nWednesday March 5, 2025 6:52 PM PST by Mitchel Broussard\\nIn March 2025, Apple updated the iPad Air and entry-level iPad, delivering unspectacular but\\nsolid spec upgrades for those looking at Apple\\'s cheaper tablets. Those updates came on the\\nheals of an October 2024 update for the iPad mini, leaving the iPad Pro from May 2024 as the\\nleast updated  iPad  in the lineup.\\nIn this guide, we\\'re taking a look at how the various models compare to help potential buyers\\nchoose which one is right for them.\\niPad Comparison\\nAll >\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\niPhone 16e WWDC 2025 iPhone 17 iPhone 17 Air iPhone 17 Pro M\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 1/24 Click for larger\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 2/24 Which iPad Is Right for You?\\nIf price is your biggest consideration, you\\'ll want to look at the standard 11th-generation\\n iPad , knowing that it contains some older technologies and limitations but is still plenty good\\nenough for many users, especially given its recent update. If you\\'re looking for portability,\\ncheck out the  iPad mini , and if you want a mid-sized  iPad  with more to offer than the entry-\\nlevel  iPad , check out the  iPad Air , which as of 2024 is available in two sizes.\\nWhat about the  iPad Pro ? Apple\\'s high-end iPads are in a class of their own, and it shows in\\ntheir higher prices. Unless you\\'re a pro-level user or price is no object, you\\'ll probably want to\\nlook to cheaper options, but the  iPad Pro  models deliver cutting-edge technology for those\\nwho need it.\\nWith that quick overview out of the way, let\\'s take a look at what each model has to offer.\\niPad Models\\n11-inch iPad\\nApple\\'s 11th-generation version of the  iPad  has an 11-inch display and the A16 chip, and it\\nstarts at $349 for the Wi-Fi only model. This is the cheapest  iPad  currently sold by Apple, and\\nit offers a good mix of features, although it does not support Apple Intelligence features given\\nits lower-end specs.\\nApple gave the  iPad  an entirely updated design with the 10th-generation model in 2022 and\\nthat carries over to the 2025 model, ditching the Home button and adopting the slim bezel\\ndesign of the  iPad Air  and  iPad Pro . It does still have Touch ID, but it\\'s been moved to the\\npower button on the top edge of the device. It also features USB-C instead of Lightning, and\\nit has an improved 12MP Wide rear-facing camera.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 3/24 This is still on the low end of the  iPad  family lineup, however, so you won\\'t get support for the\\nApple Pencil 2 (only the first-generation model or the USB-C model). Thankfully, Apple saw fit\\nto boost storage options with the latest model, and it now starts at 128GB with the ability to\\nupgrade to 256GB or, for the first time in an entry-level  iPad , 512GB.\\nKey specifications include:\\nAn 11-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone\\nSide button with  Touch ID \\nA16 chip\\n12MP Wide back camera and 12MP Landscape Ultra Wide front camera\\nFirst-generation  Apple Pencil  and  Apple Pencil  with USB-C compatibility\\nMagic Keyboard Folio compatibility\\nUSB-C port\\nAvailable in Blue, Pink, Silver, and Yellow\\niPad mini\\nNext up is the  iPad mini , which was updated in October 2024 and starts at $499 for Wi-Fi only\\nmodels. Apple similarly doubled the base storage to 128GB with this update, offering a better\\nvalue for buyers at the low end, while also offering up to 512GB of storage at the high end.\\nWith a display size of 8.3 inches, you can\\'t quite call it pocketable, but the  iPad mini  is\\ndefinitely great for having something small on the go that still offers a much larger screen\\nsize than even Apple\\'s largest iPhones.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 4/24 Looking beyond the display size, this is a capable device using an A17 Pro chip to deliver\\nsupport for  Apple Intelligence  features, so it\\'s a fairly speedy tablet. You\\'ll get an improved\\ndisplay compared to the entry-level  iPad , a 12-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, and\\nsupport for the most advanced  Apple Pencil  Pro.\\nKey specifications include:\\nFully laminated 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone\\n Touch ID  in the power button\\nA17 Pro chip with 5-core graphics and 16-core Neural Engine\\n12MP Wide back camera with Smart HDR 4 and 4K video\\n12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Smart HDR 4 and 1080p HD video\\nLandscape stereo-speaker audio\\n Apple Pencil  Pro and  Apple Pencil  (USB-C) compatibility\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 5/24 Bluetooth keyboard compatibility\\n10Gbps USB-C port\\nAvailable in Space Gray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight\\niPad Air\\nMoving toward the higher end of the  iPad  family is the  iPad Air , which was updated with the\\nM3 chip in March 2025. As of 2024, the  iPad Air  is available in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, with\\nthe smaller model starting at $599 for Wi-Fi only connectivity and the larger model starting at\\n$799. The  iPad Air  is the perfect mid-tier option that offers many of the same features as the\\ntop-of-the-line  iPad Pro  but at a lower price point, and it\\'s a great option for many users.\\nApple also released a new Magic Keyboard accessory specifically for the  iPad Air , offering\\nmuch of the same experience as the version for the  iPad Pro  with a cantilever design, function\\nkeys and, a large trackpad, but stripped down a bit to hit a lower price point.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 6/24 Key specifications of the  iPad Air  include:\\nFully laminated 11-inch or 13-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone\\n Touch ID  in the power button\\nM3 chip\\n12MP Wide rear camera with Smart HDR 4 for photos and 4K video at up to 60 fps\\nLandscape 12MP FaceTime HD front camera with Smart HDR 4\\n Apple Pencil  Pro and  Apple Pencil  with USB-C compatibility\\nMagic Keyboard and Bluetooth keyboard compatibility\\nUSB-C port\\nAvailable in Space Gray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight\\niPad Pro\\nIf you\\'re looking for true portable workstation power, then the last two iPads in the lineup, the\\n iPad Pro  models, could be what you\\'re interested in. These tablets were updated in May 2024\\nwith the M4 chip, OLED displays, thinner designs, higher starting storage capacities, and\\nmore. Pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model.\\nWhile these are now the oldest  iPad \\'s in Apple\\'s lineup, they are still a step up from the  iPad\\nAir  in almost every way, from the crisp OLED displays with 120Hz ProMotion technology for\\nsmoother display responsiveness and a USB-C connector with Thunderbolt support to a more\\npowerful M4 chip, Face ID, and a maximum of 2TB of storage.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 7/24 The  iPad Pro  is overkill for most users, but if you\\'re a pro-level user or just want the latest\\ntechnology, the  iPad Pro  has a lot to offer.\\nKey specifications of the two  iPad Pro  models include:\\n11-inch or 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED display\\n Face ID \\nM4 chip\\n12MP Wide rear camera\\nSmart HDR 4 for photos, 4K video at up to 60 fps\\nLandscape 12MP TrueDepth front camera with Center Stage, Portrait mode, Portrait\\nLighting, and Smart HDR 4\\nFour-speaker audio\\n5G connectivity\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 8/24  Apple Pencil  Pro and  Apple Pencil  with USB-C compatibility\\nMagic Keyboard and Bluetooth keyboard compatibility\\nThunderbolt / USB 4 connector\\nAvailable in Silver and Space Black\\nCustomization Options\\nNow that we\\'ve looked at the base specs of each of  iPad  models, it\\'s time to think about\\nvarious options like storage, cellular connectivity, and AppleCare+.\\nStorage: There are several storage options for each  iPad , so think about how much you\\nmight need. For the 11th-generation  iPad , Apple is offering three storage options: 128GB for\\n$349, 256GB for $449, and an all-new 512GB version for $649. The  iPad mini  also comes in\\nthree storage options: 128GB for $499, 256GB for $599, and 512GB for $799.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 9/24 The two  iPad Air  models are available in four storage capacity options, with the entry-level\\n128GB models priced at $599 for the 11-inch version and $799 for the 13-inch version. On\\nboth display sizes, 256GB is available for an additional $100, 512GB is available for an\\nadditional $300 over the base model, and 1TB is available for an additional $500 over the\\nbase model.\\nLastly, the  iPad Pro  offers the highest storage capacity options, with the base models of both\\nsizes starting at 256GB, double that of the previous generation. Those base models start at\\n$999 for 11-inch and $1,299 for 13-inch, with additional storage options including 512GB\\n($200 upgrade from base), 1TB ($600 upgrade from base), and 2TB ($1,000 upgrade from\\nbase).\\nPower-heavy users should always look to the higher-capacity  iPad  models to ensure they\\ndon\\'t have to worry about constantly deleting apps and other files for storage space.\\nOtherwise, Apple\\'s iCloud is a great way to offload files and lets you opt for a cheaper  iPad \\nwith less storage.\\nUnless you\\'re storing a large local music library, downloading lots of video for offline playback,\\nhave a ton of huge apps, or doing pro-level work requiring lots of large files, mainstream\\nusers can usually get away with the lowest-tier storage options, particularly now that all\\nmodels start with at least 64GB and more expensive models start much higher than that.\\nDisplay: For the first time, Apple is offering a nano-texture display option on an  iPad , but\\nonly on the  iPad Pro  and only on the higher-end 1TB and 2TB storage capacity options. This\\n$100 upgrade is intended for users with high-end color-managed workflows or who use their\\ndevices in demanding ambient lighting environments such as outdoors. Think real estate\\nagents and home inspectors, but there are plenty of other use cases where the reduced glare\\ncould be beneficial.\\nCellular Connectivity: If you need to ensure that you can use your  iPad  at any time,\\nincluding when you\\'re not near a Wi-Fi connection, you can opt for a Wi-Fi + Cellular option to\\nensure you\\'re always connected.\\nCellular support adds $150–$200 onto the price of all corresponding Wi-Fi  iPad  models,\\ndepending on which  iPad  and which storage capacity. You\\'ll also have to sign up for a data\\nplan for an additional cost with a supported carrier, like AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon in\\nthe United States.\\nAll told, it\\'s not a cheap upgrade, and many users prefer using their phone as a hotspot to\\ndeliver connectivity to a Wi-Fi  iPad  while on the go. But if your phone plan doesn\\'t allow for\\nhotspot usage or you just want the convenience of having your  iPad  connected directly to a\\ncellular network at all times, the option is there.\\nAll current  iPad  models support sub-6GHz 5G with data speeds that will be plenty fast for\\nmost users, but lacking support for the fastest mmWave 5G technology available in some\\nurban areas.\\nAppleCare+: New iPads come with one year of hardware repair coverage through Apple\\'s\\nlimited warranty policy, as well as up to 90 days of complimentary support. But if you want\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 10/24 more coverage, Apple offers optional  AppleCare + packages priced at $34.99/year for the  iPad \\nand  iPad mini , $39.99/year for the 11-inch  iPad Air , $49.99/year for the 13-inch  iPad Air ,\\n$74.99/year for the 11-inch  iPad Pro , and $84.99/year for the 13-inch  iPad Pro . Monthly\\npricing options at 10% of the annual rates are also available.\\n AppleCare + extends your  iPad \\'s coverage for as long as you continue to subscribe and adds\\nunlimited incidents of accidental damage coverage, subject to a service fee of $29 for screen\\ndamage and $99 for other types of accidental damage.

The second-\\ngeneration  Apple Pencil  introduced sleek design changes, magnetic charging on the  iPad mini ,\\n iPad Air , and  iPad Pro , and gesture controls, none of which are available on the original  Apple\\nPencil . A USB-C  Apple Pencil  introduced in late 2023 complicated the situation even further,\\nand then the  Apple Pencil  Pro expanded the family to four in 2024 with advanced features like\\nsqueeze and barrel roll gestures, haptic feedback, and Find My support.\\nIt might be unclear which iPads support which  Apple Pencil  models, so check out our list\\nbelow.

But if you\\'re an artist or other\\ncreative with a penchant for drawing or taking digital handwritten notes, Apple\\'s stylus is\\ndefinitely an enhancement to the  iPad  experience.\\nFor a more in-depth look at the differences between the four Apple Pencils, check out our\\ncomparison.\\nCases: Apple sells Smart Folio cases for all of its iPads, priced depending on the size of the\\ndevice. You\\'ll pay $59 for an  iPad mini  Smart Folio, $79 for an  iPad  (A16) or 11-inch  iPad Air \\nor  iPad Pro  Smart Folio, and $99 for a 13-inch  iPad Air  or  iPad Pro  Smart Folio.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 13/24 These cases magnetically attach to your  iPad , offering a degree of protection while also\\nallowing you to place the tablet in numerous angled positions. The Smart Folio cases protect\\nboth the front and rear of the tablet.\\nKeyboards: If you\\'re looking to do a lot of work on an  iPad Air  or  iPad Pro , Apple has several\\nmodels of the Magic Keyboard that include a trackpad, USB-C port with passthrough charging,\\nand more. They certainly aren\\'t cheap, priced at $269 or $299 for 11-inch versions and $319\\nor $349 for 13-inch versions, but for pro-level users, it\\'s a serious upgrade to the  iPad \\nexperience.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 14/24 Note that there are separate Magic Keyboard models for the latest  iPad Pro  and  iPad Air \\nmodels, with the  iPad Pro  models featuring backlit keys, haptic feedback on the trackpad, and\\naluminum palm rests.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 15/24 The 11th-generation  iPad  (A16) also has its own Magic Keyboard Folio, priced at $249.00 and\\navailable in White. It has a built-in trackpad, a 14-key function row, and a two-piece design\\nwith a detachable keyboard and protective back panel that both attach magnetically to the\\n iPad .\\nThese Apple-made cases are compatible with iPads that have a Smart Keyboard connector,\\nwhich is a special port that magnetically attaches the keyboard to the side or rear of the  iPad .\\nOtherwise, you can also look into popular  iPad  keyboard manufacturers like Logitech and\\nBelkin, all of which sell Bluetooth keyboards that connect to iPads wirelessly. Keyboard cases\\nare more expensive than your average case due to the added input use, but if you really plan\\non doing a lot of work and writing on your  iPad , the two-in-one keyboard/protection combo is\\nthe way to go. The hardware keyboards give a much better typing experience and free up\\nscreen space on your  iPad  by getting rid of the software keyboard.\\nCables: With the discontinuation of the 9th-generation  iPad  in May 2024, Apple has\\ncompleted the transition of its  iPad  lineup from Lightning to USB-C, simplifying cable\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 16/24 purchases.\\nAll iPads come with their required cables in the box, but if you don\\'t have many around the\\nhouse it\\'s always a good idea to stock up on more. Apple sells individual cables, but you can\\nalways shop around on Amazon for cheap and reliable brands like Anker.\\nSo... Which iPad Should You Buy?\\nOverall, Apple\\'s iPad Air is a perfect all-encompassing tablet that should hit the checkmarks\\nfor many buyers and is available in two sizes to suit. It has many of the most important\\nfeatures of the  iPad Pro  but starts at $400 less.\\nIf you\\'re on a bit more of a budget or looking for a relatively cheap tablet for a kid, the 11th-\\ngeneration iPad (A16) saves you an additional $250 compared to the  iPad Air  while giving\\nyou a similar form factor and the same display size as the smaller  iPad Air , but with a few\\ncompromises. At $349 or even cheaper on sale, it\\'s hard to beat if you\\'re a less-demanding\\nuser. Just keep in mind that it won\\'t support current and upcoming  Apple Intelligence \\nfeatures.\\nIf you\\'re someone who has preferred the small form factor of the iPad mini over the years,\\nApple\\'s latest small-sized tablet is a prime candidate for those looking for an e-reader that\\ncan perform other tasks while not taking up a huge amount of space. The  iPad mini  doesn\\'t\\nhave a  Smart Keyboard  connector like the  iPad Air  or a  Smart Keyboard  case of its own, but\\nsince the  iPad mini  isn\\'t exactly a workstation device, that\\'s not a bad trade-off (plus, you can\\nstill connect it to a Bluetooth keyboard if you want).\\nFor $100 less than the  iPad Air  at $499 (128GB Wi-Fi), the  iPad mini  still gives you a nice\\nlaminated display with True Tone and antireflective coating,  Touch ID  in the power button,\\n Apple Intelligence  and  Apple Pencil  Pro support, and solid cameras.\\n07/05/2025, 16:07 Picking the Best iPad to Buy in 2025 - MacRumors\\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-ipad-to-buy/ 17/24 51 comments\\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\\nEmail Address Subscribe\\nAnd, of course, on the other end of the spectrum are the power users.
